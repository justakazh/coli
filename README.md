# COLI - Command Orchestration & Logic Interface

    
---

## Introduction

Running workflows, managing scopes, monitoring scans, and handling files entirely from the command line can quickly become **tedious, complex, and hard to visualize**. That‚Äôs why **COLI (Command Orchestrated & Logic Interface)**  was created to **bring your CLI workflows to life**.  

With COLI, you can:
- **Visually create and connect tasks as nodes** using a drag-and-drop workflow editor
- **Manage scopes** and organize your targets efficiently
- **Monitor scans in real-time** with instant feedback
- **Access an interactive terminal** directly from your browser
- **Explore files** through a built-in explorer
- Enjoy **mobile-friendly support** for working anywhere

    DocumentRoot [document_root] # change this

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile [ssl public key location] # change this
    SSLCertificateKeyFile [ssl private key location] # change this

    <Directory [document_root]>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    # WebSocket + fallback polling
    ProxyRequests Off
    ProxyPreserveHost On

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} =websocket [NC]
    RewriteRule ^/socket.io/(.*) ws://127.0.0.1:5000/socket.io/$1 [P,L]
